# Showpad Academy: CORS Class

## Running

First, add these host names to /etc/hosts to be able to deal with all the hostnames used in the demo.

`
127.0.0.1       start.academy.dev good.academy.dev bad.academy.dev redirect.academy.dev wildcard.academy.dev
`

To run the server, just use `go run main.go` or any way you see fit.

Then go to `http://start.academy.dev:8000/f/`  to open up the experiments portal.
